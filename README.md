# Lisanify Releases

This repository hosts public installers and update manifests for the Lisanify desktop app. The application
source code lives in a private repository; only compiled binaries and the `latest.json` manifest are published
here so customers can receive in-app updates.

## Contents
- `Lisanify_<version>_x64-setup.exe` – Windows installer generated by the Tauri build pipeline.
- `latest.json` – Manifest consumed by the desktop app to detect and download new versions.

Each tag (e.g. `v0.2.0`) from the private repository triggers an automated GitHub Action that:
1. Builds and signs the installer
2. Generates the update manifest with the correct signature and download URL
3. Uploads both files to the release matching the tag in this repository

For manual downloads, navigate to the [Releases](../../releases) page and pick the required version.
